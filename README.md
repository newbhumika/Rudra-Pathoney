# 🛡️ Pathoney Honeypot  

A honeypot project built by **Team Rudra** (4 members) to capture and analyze malicious activities in a controlled environment.  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Cybersecurity threats are increasing every day. Organizations need ways to detect and analyze attacks proactively. A **honeypot** is a security mechanism that creates a decoy system to lure attackers, capture their activities, and study their behavior for better defense.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Python, Flask  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap  
- **AI Integration:** Gemini API  
- **Containerization:** Docker  
- **Honeypot:** Pathoney Honeypot (Docker Hub image: `swarnav842/pathoney-honeypot`)  

---

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage  

### 1. Prerequisites  
Ensure your system has the following installed:  
- Python **3.11.2**  
- Flask (`pip install flask`)  
- Docker  
- Virtualenv (`pip install virtualenv`)  
- Gemini API key (saved inside `.env` file)  
- Bootstrap (via CDN)  

---

### 2. Setup Honeypot (Docker)  
1. Pull the Pathoney Honeypot image:  
   ```bash
   docker pull swarnav842/pathoney-honeypot
   ```  
2. Run the container:  
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name pathoney swarnav842/pathoney-honeypot
   ```  
3. Start the container (if stopped):  
   ```bash
   docker start <container_id>
   ```  
4. Logs from the honeypot can be viewed using:  
   ```bash
   docker logs -f pathoney
   ```  

---

### 3. Setup Backend (Flask)  
1. Create a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   virtualenv .venv
   ```  
2. Activate the virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   .venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```  
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
4. Run the Flask app:  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```  

The app will be available at:  
- Localhost → [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)  
- Network → Accessible from other devices in the same network (e.g., mobile phone, tablet, etc.)
